# Embedded_ML_TensorFlowLite
Files to build ML on edge devices

I read a tweet about a company called Edge Impulse. After watching videos by their CTO and founders, I signed up (for free, https://www.edgeimpulse.com/) and started a course on Coursera called Introduction to Embedded Machine Learning. https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-embedded-machine-learning

Edge Impulse creates TensorFlow Lite machine learning models that are intended to be used on edge devices. An edge device can be a smartphone, a fitness tracker, sensors on basically anything (I purchased an arduino microcontroller and used it and my smart phone for this class).

Edge Impulse has a nice gui and I'm sure is more robust than what this Coursera instructor talks about. You can certainly code TensorFlow lite in Python manually; Edge Impulse does this for you. 

The Coursera instructor is a bit stiff in his delivery and there is a LOT of theory in the course. But he does demo using Edge Impulse for one main project. 

He also mentioned https://netron.app/, which is a cool site that shows a visual of the model Edge Impulse builds.
